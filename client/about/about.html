		<h1>Why Forecast?</h1>

		<p>Often project management and ticket tracking are seperated in large development shops.  However, smaller teams and individuals are often trying to accomplish balancing those two together.</p>

		<p>Forecast aims to make managing your feature requests with your bug fixes easy and transparent for your clients without the need for a project manager and technical lead.</p>

		<h1>This feels a bit half baked. What is the deal?</h1>
		<p>If you have stumbled upon this app and wondered why it seems lacking that would be because it is. Please allow me to explain...</p>

		<p>This app is in the early stages of development and will be improving as it is developed over the next several weeks.</p>
